Design patterns were popularized by the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software", published in 1994 by a group of four C++ engineers.


Creational Design Patterns:
    - Creational patterns consist of different mechanisms used to create objects.
    Types:
        - Singleton Pattern
        - Factory Method Pattern
        - Abstract Factory Pattern
        - Builder Pattern
        - Prototype Pattern

Structural Design Patterns:
    - Structural patterns refer to how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures.
    Types:
        - Adapter Pattern
        - Decorator Pattern
        - Facade Pattern
        - Proxy Pattern
        - Bridge pattern (refactoring.guru)
        - Composite pattern (refactoring.guru)
        - Fly weight (refactoring.guru)

Behavioral Design Patterns:
    - Behavioral patterns control communication and the assignment of responsibilities between different objects.
    Types:
        - Chain of Responsibility Pattern
        - Iterator Pattern
        - Observer Pattern
        - Command pattern (refactoring.guru)
        - Mediator Pattern (refactoring.guru)
        - Memento Pattern (refactoring.guru)
        - State Pattern (refactoring.guru)
        - Strategy Pattern (refactoring.guru)
        - Template Method (refactoring.guru)
        - Visitor (refactoring.guru)
